    "Alright, so I think I have a pretty neat idea for this package, so I'm just going to document a few of my thoughts. This is an augment package, where the idea is to take a protein sequence and generate a bunch of point mutational variants. I think this would be quite handy in certain applications, for instance antimicrobial peptide classification. There aren't too many known examples of antimicrobial peptides, but tons and tons of examples of non-antimicrobial peptides. If this were a computer vision problem, say we were trying to build a classifier for four leaf clovers vs three leaf clovers, you'd have a much easier time finding examples of three leaf vs four leaf. To compensate for this so that you have an evenish sampling you can augment the dataset byt manipulating the pictures you do have and jittering the images about to get kind of pseudoreplicates. Sure, there's lot's of ways to approach that problem, but for protein sequences it is not so easy to augment those sequences. If they are all in the same gene family, you can make a multiple sequence alignment of them and reconstruct their ancestral states using phylogenetic approaches, this would double the data size! But if that isn't the case then what can you do? Well you can take the single point mutation approach. Say for a protein of length L, generate N variants where you randomly mutate a single amino residue. That is sort of fine in practice, but we know that some mutations are more feleterious than others, if only there were a way to determine which mutations weren't likely to be deleterious... Aha! So I think we can take the dataframes generated from ESM or prot_bert and generate the top k most likely mutational variants per residue. Let's think about how that could potentially augment the data set. So for a single peptide of length L, if we take the top k substitutions per residue, that gives L*k variants, for the toy MENDEL example where L is 6, this would generate 30 variants! Which is quite substantial, for larger proteins I think you could get quite a reasanobly large number of variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, so here is what I plan to do, the prediction dataframe is pretty core to this, though for demonstration purposes, I'll probably just handmake a MENDEL dataframe. From that the main function will be an augmentPep function which will take a prediction df from a single peptide, as well k to dictate how many mutational variants per residue. An obvious caveat is the fact that the wild type residue will probably often be in the top k possible substitutions, so there will need to be a small check to insure we are getting the top k residues that are not wt. Beyond that, two aditional functions come to mind than can be built on top of this, augmentFasta and augmentPeps, which just takes augmentPep and applies it to either a fasta file or an iterable list of peptides. I should also think about how to name mutants, I feel like just posResidue + ResidueSub would  be sufficient to tag that to the original id.\n",
