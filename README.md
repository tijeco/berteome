``` python
from berteome import berteome
```

``` python
bert_tokenizer, bert_model = berteome.load_model(model_path="Rostlab/prot_bert")
```

## Install

`pip install berteome`

# How to use

Berteome makes use of the masked language model of BERT to determine
predictions for all residues in a protein sequence.

The main `berteome` library can be imported as follows:

``` python
from berteome import berteome
```

To see the models that are currently supported by `berteome`
(functionality coming soon), in the meantime here they are printed out
explicitly!

- `Rostlab/prot_bert`
- `facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D`
- `facebook/esm1b_t33_650M_UR50S`

All of these models are distributed through huggingface, and berteome
makes great use of itâ€™s API.

# Development

To build the library run the following

    nbdev export

Then, pip install in a development environment

    pip install -e '.[dev]'
